# 1.- Synopsis
The devil is in the detail is a first person horror-puzzle game inspired by some childhood nightmares of the team that developed it. In the game, we play as a child trapped in a nightmarish maze that has to solve the challenges in it to collect and bring three gnome statues to their corresponding place in order to enter the safe and warm house and wake up. However, this task will be harder than it seems, as we will be constantly chased by the Bill the Tar Man, a man eater ghoul that lives in the maze and doesn’t like intruders. 
The Maze is full of secrets, and in order to distinguish what’s real from what’s not, you will have to use the magic glasses. With them, you will be able to solve all the riddles in the maze and wake up before Bill catches you.

# 2.- First weeks of development
During the first weeks of development we started meeting to agree on a game concept that we all liked and that could fit the first person game restriction we had for this project. After each of us proposed several ideas and we discussed them as a group, we decided to go for a game in which a double vision mechanic would be a key element. All the different game concepts that were proposed during those days can be seen in the following link:

After the main game mechanic concept was chosen we started thinking about a general theme that would work with the vision mode. After some discussion, we decided that a kind of “escape room” game placed in a maze where, instead of wanting to get out a room, we want to get in to be safe. That idea defined the roots of The Devil is in the Details, and through the weeks of development that concept has evolved and changed as new ideas came up.

# 3.- My contributions to the game
During the development of The Devil is on the Details we have had to work as a team and, as part of the requirements of the course, we all had to contribute to the programming, art and design of it. However, as we were formed by four artists and two programmers, being me one of those two programmers, we all tended to do more of what we were best at. As I’ve mentioned before, with my background in programming I ended up in the role of lead gameplay and AI programmer. However, as I’m also highly interested in game design, I also had an important role as gameplay and level designer.
I think that it is also important to mention that working in a team of 6 people the coordination and communication between them is crucial, and to achieve this and finish the project successfully someone had to be in charge of this. Even though this role wasn’t decided from the beginning and didn’t directly affect the game, due to the group dynamics and my role as game designer, I ended up also working as project manager along Pablo Bueno Melchor.
In this position I was in charge of coordinating everyone, dividing tasks, setting up deadlines, checking that everyone met them and, inside the game, I also had to make sure that all the different features that each of us programmed worked well together.
